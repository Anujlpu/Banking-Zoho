    <h2>A focus on what matters</h2>
    <p>
      Zoho is committed to spending your money wisely. We invest more in product
      development and customer support than in sales and marketing. It always
      struck us as paradoxical to charge the customer extra for the privilege of
      marketing back to them. By keeping our cost of attracting customers low,
      we keep our prices affordable and pass the savings onto our users. <br />
      We’re gentle in our sales approach, so we don't push our people to push
      you. You won’t find us trying to endlessly upsell you, or buying your
      loyalty through multi-year contracts. And with growth that regularly
      outstrips our competitors, we know that this model works. <br />
    </p>
    <h2>A private company with public vision</h2>
    <p>
      We’ve stayed private and we’ve never taken other people’s money. Neither
      will change. This keeps us independent and beholden to only the customer,
      permitting a long term view to naturally unfold. We are private, but far
      from small. With nearly 11,000 employees across the globe, our style of
      unconventional thinking seems to have paid off. <br />
      Our investment in people is a vital part of our R&D edge. We have a
      comprehensive program to hire high school students and train them - a
      program we call Zoho Schools of Learning. Over 15% of our engineers come
      from this program. Not only is the program good for our company, it is
      also good for the communities we live in.
